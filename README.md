my Legacy app

For so many reasons, a lot of mobile money accounts become deactivated over a certain period of time due to inactivity. And sometimes, these reasons of inactivity are beyond the control of the user or owner of the mobile money accounts.

This could be death, or disability of the user. So in this unfortunate case, what happens to the users’ mobile money balance? To your cryptocurrency?

Our application to provide solutions to this problem is what we are calling ‘MY LEGACY PROJECT’
